    <h3>A Brief History Behind Planet Jupiter</h3>
    <p>Jupiter is the 5th planet in the Solar System and was discovered by astronomer Galileo Galilei in 1610. He discovered it using a small telescope that he made himself. He realized that he had discovered Jupiter when he saw that the planet had four moons orbiting it rather than stars. This was a big discovery because people in the West always thought that the Earth was the center of the universe. With Jupiter's discovery, we finally realized that there are bigger objects out there in the universe, some of which are larger than anything we'd ever imagined.</p> 
    <p>Jupiter is the most important planet in our solar system because if it weren't for this gas giant, we would not be here. Our solar system is surrounded by an asteroid belt, and because Jupiter is located toward the center of our system, it uses its strong gravitational pull to suck in any asteroids that come toward us, <strong>destroying</strong> them with its powerful gravitational force.</p>

    <h2>Other Facts About Planet Jupiter</h2>
    <img src="media/image3.jpg" alt="An accurate picture to show exactly how big Jupiter is compared to other planets in out solar system">
    <p>You can fit 1,000 Earths into Jupiter and that would be the size of the planet. We are very <strong>very</strong> tiny compared to space.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Jupiter was named after the king of the gods in Roman mythology. Given that Jupiter is the biggest planet, it deserves that title.</li>
      <li>Those beautiful clouds surrounding Jupiter are actually extremely powerful storms.</li>
      <li>Unlike the Earth where it needs land to stop storms, Jupiter has no land since it's a Gas Giant. So, it's storms will continue on and on.</li>
      <li>Jupiter is the fastest rotating planet in the entire solar system. One day around the sun lasts about 9 1/2 hours on Earth.</li>
      <li>Jupiter is mostly made of hydrogen and helium gas.</li>
      <li>Jupiter just like Saturn has rings.</li>
      <li>Jupiter's great red spot is a gigantic cyclone, larger than Earth, and it has been raging for three centuries.</li>
      <li>Jupiter is often called a gas giant because the planet is mostly made of hydrogen and helium gas.</li>
      <li>Because Jupiter is made of hydrogen and helium gas much like the sun, it's often called a failed star because it doesn't meet the requirements for it to be a star.</li>
      <li>Jupiter has a lot of moons. Around 95 moons to be exact. It's top 4 largest being <strong>Io</strong>, <strong>Callisto</strong>, <strong>Ganymede</strong>, and <strong>Europa</strong></li> 
      <li>Jupiter's magnetic field is so strong that NASA has captured audio with the Juno spacecraft of what Jupiter sounds like.</li>

    <h3>Overall Conclusion</h3>
    <p>While we may never be able to see what's inside Jupiter due to the planet's immense power, we can still study and admire it for protecting us for so many years. However, not everything last forever as studies from NASA have shown that the planet is shrinking. So many mysteries are yet to be discovered about this mysterious planet, and we continue to explore what this fascinating planet has in store for us.</p>
